## DSA - ASSIGNMENT - 3
### RollNO: 2021101128

#### Q1
     HERE I HAVE ACTUALLY USED A SINGLE BIG CODE FOR OJ
     I HAVE USED A GLOBAL VARIABLE
     BUT AS WE HAVE TO ATTACH .h,.c files as well
     I AM WRITING THE FINDLITE TREE AND DELETE TREE IN q1.c only
     FINDLITE TREE ==> Function name used ==> "s max_sum_bst(tnode* root);"
     q.h,q.c ==> queue implementation
     tree.h,tree.c ==> tree implementaion
     I AM ALSO ATTACHING THE ACTUAL ANSWER FILE AS "ans.c" - TOTAL FILE -- submitted in oj
#### Q2
    No ADT was Required For this Question.
#### Q3
    """ int search(struct HashTable* T,int key); is used instead of bool """
    struct HashTable* Delete(struct HashTable* T,int key); is used instead of 'D'


    main3.c contains a sample implementation of the functions created 
    it also contains driver code in comments
    these 4 variables that were used to calculate average INSERT/SEARCH operations have been commented
    double insert_op=0;
    double search_op=0;
    double no_of_insertions=0;  // NO OF INSERT COMMANDS BY USER
    double no_of_searches=0;    // NO OF SEARCH COMMANDS BY USER

#### Q4
    ADT USED IS INSIDE THE q4.c SO NO EXTRA ADT .h,.c are used;
